# Summary
System identification involves constructing mathematical models of complex dynamic systems using input-output data, enabling analysis and prediction of system behaviour in both time and frequency domains. This approach can model the entire system or capture specific dynamics within it. For meaningful analysis, it is essential for the model to reflect the underlying system behaviour accurately. This paper introduces NonSysId, an open-sourced MATLAB software package designed for nonlinear system identification, specifically focusing on NARMAX models. The software incorporates an advanced term selection methodology that prioritises simulation (free-run) accuracy while preserving model parsimony. A key feature is the integration of iterative Orthogonal Forward Regression (iOFR) with Predicted Residual Sum of Squares (PRESS) statistic-based term selection, facilitating robust model generalisation without the need for a separate validation dataset. Furthermore, techniques for reducing computational overheads are implemented. These features make `NonSysId` particularly suitable for real-time applications such as structural health monitoring, fault diagnosis, and biomedical signal processing, where it is a challenge to capture the signals under consistent conditions, resulting in limited or no validation data.

# Statement of Need

System identification is at the intersection of control theory, dynamic systems theory and machine learning, which aims to derive mathematical models of dynamic linear or nonlinear systems based on experimental input-output data. Its objectives are (i) accurate inputâ€“output mapping for prediction and (ii) faithful capture of underlying dynamics of the actual system [@ljung1998system; @billings2013a]. This paper focuses on the widely used discrete-time nonlinear auto-regressive with exogenous input (NARX) models, with ARX as the linear special case. In this setting, system identification determines a functional mapping between past input/output terms (input/output lagged terms) to the current output $y(t)$, where $t$ denotes the time index. This mapping may be polynomial, a neural network, or even a fuzzy logic-based model. We focus on polynomial NARX models with maximum degree $N_p \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}$. For example:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:narx_exmpl}
    y(t) = \theta_{1}y(t-1) + \theta_{2}u(t-2) + \theta_{3}y(t-2)^{2}u(t-1)^{3} + \xi(t).
\end{equation}

Here, $y(t-1)$ and $u(t-2)$ are linear terms (degree $1$ monomials), while $y(t-2)^{2}u(t-1)^{3}$ is a nonlinear term (degree $5$ monomial). The NARX model given in \autoref{eq:narx_exmpl} has a polynomial degree $N_p=5$ (highest degree of any monomial). NARX models are equivalent to RNNs [@Sum1999] and widely used in fields such as control, condition monitoring, advanced manufacturing, and the modelling and analysis of physiological and biological systems [@Chiras2002;@WANG2024;@ZAINOL2022;@RITZBERGER2017;@Gao2023;@HE2016;@HE2021;@LIU2024]. Extending the NARX model with a noise model yields the nonlinear auto-regressive moving average with exogenous inputs (NARMAX) model. Additionally, the NOFRF concept [@Lang2005] facilitates a detailed frequency-domain understanding of how nonlinearities affect input-output dynamics captured by NARX models [@Lang2005;@BAYMA2018;@Gunawardena2018;@ZHU2022]. This enhances the utility of NARX models by offering a comprehensive framework for analysing and interpreting nonlinear systems [@Zhu2021].

The key challenge in learning a polynomial NARX model is to identify a parsimonious model structure from a set of candidate terms (monomials). Especially in nonlinear cases (Chapter 1, [@billings2013a]), superfluous terms can lead to spurious dynamics [@AGUIRRE1995;@mendes1998a]. The Orthogonal Forward Regression (OFR) algorithm, also known as Forward Regression Orthogonal Least Squares (FROLS) [@chen1989b; @billings1987a], can evaluate the independent contribution of each candidate term to the output according to a term selection criterion [@korenberg1988a; @WANG1996; @hong2003], enabling efficient step-wise forward selection of terms. Using the error reduction ratio (ERR), a popular term selection criterion, the OFR incrementally chooses terms that maximise the explained variance (model fit). Recently, two open-sourced packages for system identification have been introduced: `SysIdentPy` [@Lacerda2020] for Python and the `narmax` package [@AYALA2020] for R. Both packages are well-developed and comprehensive. However, they are based on the original FROLS/OFR algorithm. Concerns persist regarding the original OFR algorithm (OFR-ERR), which relies on the ERR for term selection [@Piroddi2003;@Mao1997]. These concerns are mainly regarding the selection of redundant/incorrect terms, overfitting and inaccuracies/instability in long-horizon prediction (simulation, free-run or model-predicted output). These are due to inputs which do not persistently excite the system under consideration (i.e., input not informative to effectively stimulate the system) or the presence of complex noise structures [@Piroddi2003;@Mao1997]. 

Beyond obtaining parsimony, models must generalise well to unseen data, which is assessed through suitable cross-validation strategies [@Little2017; @Stone1974]. However, in some real-time applications, such as structural health monitoring or fault diagnosis, obtaining separate validation data may be impractical [@Gharehbaghi2022; @Vamsikrishna2024]. Similarly, in neuroscience, rapidly changing complex dynamics between brain regions make it difficult to obtain data which precisely contains the same behaviour for validation purposes [@Kunjan2021; @Seedat2024; @Chen2016; @Eichenbaum2021; @Lehnertz2021]. The following section outlines the features in the `NonSysId` package, previously proposed to address these challenges when applying system identification.

# Features in `NonSysId`

The `NonSysId` package introduced in this paper implements an OFR-based system identification methodology designed to address the key issues mentioned in the previous section. This is achieved by integrating and extending several OFR variants already available in the literature [@guo2015a;@WANG1996;@hong2003], along with a proposed simulation-based model selection procedure. At the time of writing, `NonSysId` is the only open-sourced package that implements previously proposed solutions to address the limitations of the original OFR algorithm directly. 

To overcome limitations of the original OFR, the `NonSysId` package implements the iterative OFR (iOFR) algorithm [@guo2015a], simulation-based stability tests (bounded-input bounded-output) and model selection for improved long-horizon prediction and stability. Here, the candidate models generated at each iteration of iOFR are simulated using a constant input of zeros and ones separately. If the corresponding outputs of a model remain bounded with a small variance, typically less than $10^{-2}$, it is regarded as stable. From the stable set of models, the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) [@Schwarz1978; @Stoica2004], based on the mean squared simulated error (MSSE) [@Piroddi2003], selects the best model in the current iteration. Furthermore, the package integrates the PRESS-statistic-based [@Allen1974] term selection criterion [@WANG1996; @hong2003], enabling efficient step-wise forward selection of terms that minimise the one-step ahead leave-one-out cross-validation error. These enhancements allow for robust term selection (compared to the original OFR-EER), built-in cross-validation, and generate models with long-horizon prediction capabilities and simulation stability [@AGUIRRE2010]. For NARX models, the candidate term set can be extensive and computationally demanding in the iFRO algorithm [@chen1989b; @billings1987a; @guo2015a]. `NonSysId`, based on [@Wei2004] and [@guo2015a], incorporates strategies to speed up the iterative step-wise forward selection process. Additionally, the package includes correlation-based residual analysis techniques for validating nonlinear models [@Billings1983]. These features in the `NonSysId` package make system identification feasible for real-time applications where inputs may not be persistently exciting and separate validation datasets may be unavailable.   

# Examples

This section presents two examples showcasing the use of the NonSysID package, which implements $\text{iOFR}_{S}$ with PRESS-statistic-based term selection. The first example utilises synthetic data generated from a NARX model, while the second focuses on real data obtained from an electro-mechanical system.

## Synthetic data example

The following example demonstrates how to identify a NARX model using the `NonSysId` package. In this example, we consider a NARX model of a DC motor (\autoref{eq:NARX_eg}) as described in [@Lacerda2017].
\begin{multline} \label{eq:NARX_eg}
    y(t) = 1.7813y(t-1) - 0.7962y(t-2) + 0.0339u(t-1) + 0.0338u(t-2)\\
    - 0.1597y(t-1)u(t-1) - 0.1396y(t-1)u(t-2)\\
    + 0.1297y(t-2)u(t-1) + 0.1086y(t-2)u(t-2) + 0.0085y(t-2)^2
\end{multline}
In \autoref{eq:NARX_eg}, $y(t)$ is the output and $u(t)$ is the input at the time sample $t$. The NARX model is excited using two inputs: (a) White noise, $u(t)\sim\mathcal{N}(0,1)$, and (b) a multi-tone sinusoidal, $u(t) = 0.2\big( 4\sin{(\pi t)} + 1.2\sin{(4\pi t)} + 1.5\sin{(8\pi t)} + 0.5\sin{(6\pi t)} \big)$. The model was simulated for 1000 time samples. Matlab scripts for this example are available in the code repository, along with documentation in the code repository, which provides a straightforward guide for using $\text{iOFR}_{S}$ in the `NonSysId` package.

\autoref{fig:narx_eg_a_io} and \autoref{fig:narx_eg_b_io} depict the training and testing data alongside the model-simulated output for the inputs (a) and (b), respectively. The term `testing data` is used to refer to data not explicitly included during training, as the model is already validated through leave-one-out cross-validation during the identification/training process.

![**Model identification results under input (a)**. The model simulation output $\hat{y}(t)$ is shown against the actual output $y(t)$ of the system given in \autoref{eq:NARX_eg}. The input $u(t)$ is a Gaussian white noise signal. Only the first 60 samples are used for identifying/training the model using $\text{iOFR}_{S}$ in the `NonSysId` package. The error variance (residual variance) in this case is $1.6018e^{-25}$.\label{fig:narx_eg_a_io}](Figures/ex_dc_motor_a_60.svg){width="80%"}

\autoref{tbl:inpt_a_param} and \autoref{tbl:inpt_b_param} present the identified terms and parameter values of the corresponding NARX models under inputs (a) and (b), respectively. These tables also include the mean squared PRESS error and the ERR metrics for each term. The values of these metrics depend on the order in which the terms were added to the model during the forward selection procedure. The mean squared PRESS error reflects the predicted cross-validation error after the term is added to the model. Sorting \autoref{tbl:inpt_a_param} and \autoref{tbl:inpt_b_param} in descending order of the mean squared PRESS error reveals the sequence of the terms added. For example, in `Table 1`, the term $u(t-1)$ was added first, followed by $y(t-1)$, $y(t-2)$, and so on. The ERR represents the proportion of the actual output variance explained by each corresponding term.

![**Model identification results under input (b)**. The model simulated output, $\hat{y}(t)$, is compared with the actual output, $y(t)$, as defined in \autoref{eq:NARX_eg}. The input is a multi-tone sinusoidal. In this case, the portion of $y(t)$ used for identification/training (yellow curve) is less informative compared to input (a), as fewer system dynamics are excited due to the limited frequency components in the input signal. Therefore, up to 200 samples are used for identifying the model using $\text{iOFR}_{S}$ in the `NonSysId` package. The error variance (residual variance) is $8.2178e^{-18}$. Using fewer than 200 samples results in a sub-optimal model, as insufficient data limits the ability to capture the system's dynamics effectively.\label{fig:narx_eg_b_io}](Figures/ex_dc_motor_b_200.svg){width="80%"}

The correlation-based statistical validation tests for nonlinear models [@Billings1983] are presented in \autoref{fig:narx_eg_a_val} and \autoref{fig:narx_eg_b_val}. This indicates some bias in the model, however, this is minimal as the variances of the model residuals are $1.6018e^{-25}$ and $8.2178e^{-18}$, respectively, for (a) and (b), compared to the training data variances of $0.069$ and $0.0581$.

## Real data example

The real data in this example is obtained from an electromechanical system described in [@Lacerda2017b]. The system comprises two DC motors, one as a driver and the other as a generator, mechanically coupled by a shaft. The input is the voltage applied to the driver motor. This input is a pseudo-random binary signal (PRBS) designed to excite the system over a range of dynamics. The output of the system is the rotational speed (angular velocity) of the generator motor.

The model simulation output $\hat{y}(t)$ is presented against the actual output $y(t)$ of the system given in \autoref{eq:NARX_eg}. The input $u(t)$ is a PRBS. Only 250 samples are used for identifying/training the model using $\text{iOFR}_{S}$ in the `NonSysId' package.\label{fig:narx_eg_rldt_sys}](Figures/ele_mech_sysId.svg){width="100%"}

# Future Work
Currently, the `NonSysId` package is capable of identifying single-input single-output (SISO) and multi-input single-output (MISO) models. However, the correlation-based residual analysis is limited to handling only SISO models. In the future, we plan to extend the package to identify multi-input multi-output (MIMO) and enable validation for both MISO and MIMO systems. While the `NonSysId` package currently supports polynomial NARX models, future versions will broaden its scope to allow  $\text{iOFR}_{S}$ to be applied to a wider range of basis functions. Furthermore, an open-sourced Python version of this package is expected to be released in the future.
